# 6-Letter Wordle
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This website allows you to play the classic game of "Wordle" with 6 letter answers. Every round, the computer randomly selects a common six letter word from the English dictionary. The goal is to guess that word in 6 tries or less. To do so, the user will input a word. Based off of that guess, the computer will provide some hints to help them reach the correct answer.
Before doing so, the website will check the input. It will make sure the word is indeed six letters long. After that, it will check to make sure the input is a valid word from the English dictionary. In my code, I have put in a list of almost 30,000 six letter words. The computer will check if the user's guess is included in the list. If the guess successfully goes through both of these, then each of the tiles that display the letters of the word will change color.
If the letter of the guessed word is in the computer's word and in the correct spot, then the tile will turn green. If it is in the word but in the wrong spot, then the tile will turn yellow. If the letter is not in the word at all, then the tile will turn gray. There is a possiblity that letters will repeat in a word, so beware of that!
If the user is able to successfully guess the word, all tiles will turn green. Soon after that, the webpage will automatically refresh for another round with a new word. If the user runs out of guesses, then the computer will display the correct word, and then it will refresh the page.
In my code, I have 4 files. My file named "6-letter-words.txt" contains my list of valid six letter words. My "index.html" file contains all the code for the actual website. My "wordle.js" file has all of the source code for the website. All of the guesses are evaluated with it. Lastly, my "styles.css" file makes my website look presentable and appealing.
